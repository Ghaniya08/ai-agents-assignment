Agentic AI Project — Assignment 2
This project includes three mini agent-based systems built using OpenAI Agent SDK + Runner. Each system simulates real-world use cases by handing off between multiple AI agents and using custom tools.

Agents:

CareerAgent – suggests career fields based on user interest.

SkillAgent – provides a skill roadmap (beginner to advanced).

JobAgent – explains real-world job options related to the field.

Tool Used: get_career_roadmap()
