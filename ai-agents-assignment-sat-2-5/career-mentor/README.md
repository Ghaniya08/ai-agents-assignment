- Starts by asking the user about their interests.
- Suggests possible career fields.
- Shares a skill roadmap from beginner to advanced level.

## Agents Used

- **CareerAgent** â€“ This is the starting agent. It talks to the user and suggests career fields based on their interests.
- **SkillAgent** â€“ After a field is chosen, this agent explains what skills are needed and in what order to learn them.
- **JobAgent** â€“ This agent provides job types, where to find them, and interview tips.
